<H1>Grammar compiler options</H1>
<P>
There are three options associated with the grammar compiler&#58;
<OL>
<P><LI><B><I>Non-uniform probability computation</I></B>
<P>By default, grammars are compiled with what is known as the uniform
probability computation, which means that all words out of a given state are
equally likely. The non-uniform probably option enables the developer to turn
the uniform probability computation off.
<P>The recognition performance differences between the two options is
strongly grammar dependent.  An extreme example is&#58;
<PRE>
   &lt;Number&gt; = "point" &lt;digit&gt; &#124; &lt;digit&gt;
   &lt;digit&gt;  = 0 &#124; 1 &#124; 2 &#124; 3 &#124; 4 &#124; 5 &#124; 6 &#124; 7 &#124; 8 &#124; 9
</PRE>
The first word that can be spoken is "point" or a digit.
With the uniform probability computation, all
initial words have probability 1/11.
Without the uniform
probability computation, "point" has a probability of 0.5, while each digit has
a probability of only 0.05.
<P>Without the uniform probability computation, language model
probabilities
are assigned to be locally uniform for each production rule in the BNF file.
Take the following example&#58;
<PRE>
   &lt;A&gt; = &lt;a1&gt; &#124; &lt;a2&gt;
   &lt;a1&gt; = "West Palm"
   &lt;a2&gt; = "Hawthorne" &#124; "Yorktown"
</PRE>
<P>Without a uniform probability computation, &lt;a1&gt; and &lt;a2&gt; each get
probability 0.5. &lt;a1&gt; expands to a single terminal,
"West Palm," which has probability 0.5 x 1 or 0.5.  Since &lt;a2&gt; expands to
two terminals, which are considered equally likely, "Hawthorne" and "Yorktown"
each get probability 0.5 x 0.5 or 0.25.  Consequently, "West Palm" has twice
the probability of the other alternative phrases.  This allows an application
developer the opportunity to bias word probabilities, where they are known or
where they make sense to use.
<P>If &lt;A&gt; were rewritten as&#58;
<PRE>
   &lt;A&gt; = "West Palm" &#124; "Hawthorne" &#124; "Yorktown"
</PRE>
then all possibilities are equally likely.  This is what the uniform
probability computation will generate, independent of how the rules are
expressed in the BNF file.
<P>To be independent of rule construction in BNF files, most application
developers would likely want to keep the default; that is, they should use the
uniform probability computation.
<P><LI><B><I>Mumble words</I></B>
<P>Use this option to generate
an FSG file that handles cases where
the end user injects mumbling or
other non-speech noise while speaking.
For example, in a grammar with the following construct&#58;
<PRE>

  &lt;rule&gt; = open &lt;program&gt;

</PRE>
the user might say "uhm...open Lotus Notes" instead of
"open Lotus Notes."
Specifying the mumble words option
causes the speech engine
to ignore any speech that
is not defined as valid by the BNF grammar.
<P>You can also tell the speech
engine to return the
non-speech noise text back to the application,
along with the word or phrase
that was recognized.  A mumble is flagged as an SM_WORD with an empty spelling
("") in an SM_RECOGNIZED_PHRASE message.
Flag settings for mumble on a run-time SmDefineGrammar
call override the flags compiled into the FSG.
<P><LI><B><I>Silence words</I></B>
<P>Use this option to generate an FSG file that handles cases where the end
user pauses briefly while speaking a command. For example, in a grammar with
the following construct&#58;
<PRE>

  &lt;rule&gt; = open &lt;program&gt;

</PRE>
the user might say "open &lt;pause&gt; Lotus Notes" instead of
"open Lotus Notes."
Specifying this option causes the speech engine to ignore any silence within an
utterance.
<P>
SMAPI treats silence similarly to mumbles.  Silence is allowed within a
phrase, and is returned as an SM_WORD with a spelling of "&lt;silence&gt;."
As with the mumble words option, flag settings for silence on a run-time
SmDefineGrammar call override the flags compiled into the FSG.
</OL>

<HR>
<H1>Compiling grammar files</H1>
Grammar files are compiled using the program <TT>vtbnfc.exe</TT>,
the syntax of the command is:
<PRE>

vtbnfc [-n] [-m | -m- | -m+] [-s | -s- | -s+] [-o outfile] grammarfile

</PRE>
The available options are:
<p><DL>
<DT><strong>-n</strong>
<DD>This option causes the uniform probability computation to  be turned off.
<p>
<DT><strong>-m</strong>
<DD>This option instructs the compiler to enable mumble words.
This option (called "mumble mode") allows the user to have filled pauses in his or
her speech. For example, consider a grammar that accepts <I>move up four words</I> and a
user saying   <I>move up, ah, four words</I>. Without this option (-m) selected, this
phrase would not be recognized since <i>ah</I> is not in the grammar. However,
with the option enabled the phrase would be recognized.

<UL>
<LI>Use <strong>-m</strong> to tell the speech engine to enable mumble words, but
not to return the mumble text.
<LI>Use <strong>-m+</strong> to tell the speech engine to enable mumble words
and to return the mumble text.
Without this option, the mumble words mentioned above would not be returned
to the application (In, the example above where the user said <I>move up, ah, four words</I>
the words <TT>move up four words</TT> would be sent to the application. With this option
enabled, the mumble words are also sent to the application.
<LI>Use <strong>-m-</strong> to disable mumble words (this is the default).
</UL>
<p>
<DT><strong>-s</strong>
<DD>This option instructs the compiler to enable silence words.
<UL>
<LI>Use <strong>-s</strong> to tell the speech engine to enable silences, but not to
return silence words (this is the default).
<LI>Use <strong>-s+</strong> to tell the speech engine to enable silences and to
return silence words.
<LI>Use <strong>-s-</strong> to disable silence words.
</UL>
<p>
<DT><strong>-o<I>filename</I></strong>
<DD>This option specifies the name of the output file. By default the
output file has the same name as the input file but with the extension
<tt>.fsg</TT>.
<p>
<DT><strong>grammarfile</strong>
<DD>The name of the BNF grammar file to be compiled.  The grammar file
name must be fully qualified if it does not reside in the current directory.
The file extension does not have to be specified (it defaults to .bnf).
If you write non-English grammars (for examples, those with accented characters
or "umlate"), the grammar file must be in code page 1252 so that the special
characters are handled properly.
