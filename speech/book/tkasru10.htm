<P>
These error messages are generated by the speech engine:
<UL>
<P><LI><B>Bad Data in File '%s'</B>
<P>Indicates problems with data found in a successfully opened file.
Files have been damaged or incompatible speech data is
being used.
Restore the file indicated from backup or reinstall
IBM VoiceType Dictation.
<P><P>
<P><LI><B>Bad Value '%s' for Tag '%s' in File '%s'</B>
<P>Control data is inconsistent.  Files have been damaged or
incompatible speech data is being used.  Restore the file
indicated from backup or reinstall the IBM VoiceType Dictation.
<P><P>
<P><LI><B>Duplicate Use of Vocabulary Name '%s'</B>
<P>A duplicate name has been used to define a vocabulary (static or
dynamic).
<P><P>
<P><LI><B>Exceeded Limit of %d %s</B>
<P>A system limit has been exceeded; for example, the maximum number of
defined vocabularies is 100.
<P><P>
<P><LI><B>Failed to Open File '%s'</B>
<P>The specified file failed to open successfully.
The file has probably
been inadvertently erased.
Restore the file indicated from backup or
reinstall IBM VoiceType Dictation.
<P><P>
<P><LI><B>Missing Tag '%s' in File '%s'</B>
<P>A required control parameter (tag) was not found
in the specified file.
Control data is inconsistent.
Files have been damaged or
incompatible speech data is being used.
Restore the file
indicated from backup or reinstall IBM VoiceType Dictation.
<P><P>
<P><LI><B>Severe Error in %s (%d)</B>
<P>A variety of severe error conditions that typically terminate the
recognition session.
Errors that refer to the dictation adapter, FM_SP or DM_SP are
IBM VoiceType Dictation Adapter related problems and require running
the hardware diagnostic tests to locate the problem.
File write errors indicate file system problems.
For example, the hard disk is full.
<P><P>
<P><LI><B>Mailbox</B>
<P>Errors might occur if one of the engine tasks fails and
communication breaks down.
Therefore, this error is most likely secondary
to the primary problem.
<P><P>
<P><LI><B>Label Buffer Overrun</B>
<P>In these cases the session is not ended, only the microphone is
forced off.
This situation is caused by a very long pause in
dictation (approximately three minutes) or by an ill behaved
application that turns on the microphone and fails to ask for
recognized words.
