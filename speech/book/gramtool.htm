There are several utility programs that will assist you
in evaluating grammars that you write:
<UL>
<LI> fsgenum.exe: enumerates strings accepted by the grammar
<LI> fsgtest.exe: determines whether input strings are accepted by the grammar
<LI> fsgprint.exe: displays the graph that defines the grammar
</UL>

This document provides a brief description of these tools.

<p><h2>FSGENUM.EXE</h2>
The program fsgenum.exe  generates strings that will be
accepted by a specific grammar. This tool is especially
useful in determining whether a grammar overgenerates---
that is, whether the grammar accepts strings that it should not.

For example, suppose we want  a
grammar that will parse (or accept) the following sentences:<p>
<PRE>
   The boy saw the dog.
   The dog saw the boy.
   The cat saw the dog.
   He saw the dog.
</PRE><p>

and we write the following simple grammar (see <A HREF="bnf.htm">writing grammar files</A>):

<PRE>

;; saw.bnf
;;
&lt;s&gt;  = &lt;np&gt; &lt;vp&gt; .
&lt;vp&gt; = &lt;v&gt; &lt;np&gt;  .
&lt;np&gt; = &lt;det&gt; &lt;n&gt; |
       &lt;pro&gt;     .

; lexicon
&lt;det&gt; = the .
&lt;n&gt;  = dog |
       boy |
       cat .
&lt;pro&gt; = he .
&lt;v&gt;   = saw .
</PRE> <p>

After <A HREF="vtbnfc.htm">compiling this grammar using vtbnfc.exe</a> we want to
examine what strings the grammar accepts.
Using fsgenum.exe (the details will be explained shortly) we
see that it generates the following:

<p>
<MENU>
<i>
<LI>the boy saw the dog
<LI>the cat saw the dog
<LI>the dog saw the boy
<LI>he saw the cat
<LI>the dog saw the dog
<LI>the dog saw he  </I>
</MENU><p>
As we can now see, the grammar overgenerates---
it accepts a string that is not in the language---
<i>the dog saw he</i>.  We can now rewrite the
grammar to prevent this string from being accepted.
To give a more practical example, rules that allow for the
acceptance of <i>twelve hundred dollars</i> might also
contribute to the acceptance of the ill-formed <i>four thousand twelve
hundred dollars</i>.

Overgeneration is a common error in writing complex
grammars and this tool is a useful debugging aid.

<h3> Syntax of fsgenum.exe</h3>
The syntax of this tool is:
<pre>
fsgenum [options] fsg-filename
</pre>

The available options are:
<DL>
<DT><strong>-r<I> num</I></strong>
<DD>This option generates a set of <i>num</i> strings described by the fsg file.
For example, <tt>fsgenum -r 10 saw.fsg</tt> will display 10 strings that
saw.fsg will accept.
<DT><strong>-R<I> num</I></strong>
<DD>This option generates a random set of <i>num</i> strings described by the fsg
file. That is, a different set of strings will be generated each
time the <tt>fsgenum -R <i>num</i></tt> command is issued. (Whereas repeated uses
of the <tt>fsgenum -r <i>num</i></tt> command will generate the same set of strings
as output.)
<DT><strong>-f </strong>
<DD>This option generates the full set of strings produced by the fsg file.
<DT><strong>-a</strong>
<DD>This option shows the <A HREF="bnf.htm#annotation">annotations</a> associated with each generated string.
<DT><strong>-p</strong>
<DD>This option displays the probability associated with each string.
<DT><strong>-l <i>num</i></strong>
<DD>This option defines the maximum number of times a <A HREF="bnf.htm#kleene">Kleene star or plus</a> is  iterated.
</DL>
<p>
<h3>Example</h3>
We compile the following BNF file to produce np.fsg

<PRE>

;; np.bnf
;;
&lt;np&gt;  = &lt;det&gt; &lt;adj&gt;* &lt;n&gt;.

; lexicon

&lt;adj&gt; = old .
&lt;det&gt; = the .
&lt;n&gt;   = dog .
</PRE> <p>


<tt>fsgenum np.fsg</tt>  and <tt>fsgenum -f np.fsg</tt> both produce
the following output:
<pre>

the dog
the old dog

</pre>

<tt>fsgenum -f -l 5 np.fsg</tt> produces the output:
<pre>

the dog
the old dog
the old old dog
the old old old dog
the old old old old dog

</pre>
<p><hr>
<h2>FSGTEST.EXE</h2>
This tool determines whether a given string (received from standard
input) is accepted by the specified grammar.  For example, using the
np.fsg file described immediately above, we start this tool by
issuing the command:

<pre>

fsgtest np.fsg

</pre>

After issuing this command a user can type in a string followed by the
enter key. (However, it should be noted that the program does not produce
a prompt.) If the entered string is accepted by np.fsg the string will be
echoed. If it is rejected the string is echoed with a preceding asterisk.
This is illustrated in the following example (where the user input is in
bold).

<pre>
<strong>
fsgtest np.fsg
the dog</strong>
  the dog
<strong>the old</strong>
* the old
<strong>the old dog</strong>
  the old dog
<strong>[ctrl-c]</strong>
The external process was cancelled by a Ctrl+Break or another process.

</pre>

A set of test strings can be input to this program by using file redirection.
For example, suppose we have a currency grammar (compiled as currency.fsg) that we would like to test. We
have a file, <tt>good-set</tt>, containing strings we would like the grammar
to accept:


<pre>
twelve hundred dollars
four thousand two hundred and eleven dollars
a dollar fifty
a dollar and a half
one and a half dollars
</pre>

We also have a file, <tt>bad-set</tt>, of ill-formed strings that we want the grammar to
reject:

<pre>
four thousand twelve hundred dollars
four dollars fifty
one dollar and a half
</pre>

We can test <tt>good-set</tt> by using the command:
<pre>
fsgtest currency.fsg &lt; good-set
</pre>
which results in the following output:
<pre>
  twelve hundred dollars
  four thousand two hundred and eleven dollars
  a dollar fifty
  a dollar and a half
  one and a half dollars
</pre>

 We can test <tt>bad-set</tt> by using
 <pre>
fsgtest currency.fsg &lt; bad-set
</pre>
which results in the following output:

<pre>
* four thousand twelve hundred dollars
* four dollars fifty
* one dollar and a half
</pre>
<h3> Syntax of fsgtest.exe</h3>
The syntax of this tool is:<p>
<pre>
fsgtest [options] fsg-filename
</pre>

The available options are:
<p><DL>
<DT><strong>-a</strong>
<DD>This option shows the annotations associated with the accepted input string.
<DT><strong>-p</strong>
<DD>This option displays the probability associated with each string.
</DL>

<h3>Example</h3>
(Once again, user input is shown in bold)


<pre>
<strong>
fsgtest -p np.fsg
the dog</strong>
0.50029 the dog
<strong>the old</strong>
******* the old
<strong>the old dog</strong>
0.25029 the old dog
<strong>[ctrl-c]</strong>
The external process was cancelled by a Ctrl+Break or another process.

</pre>

To illustrate the use of annotations we compile the following bnf file
to produce np2.fsg:


<PRE>

;; np.bnf
;;
&lt;np&gt;  = &lt;det&gt; &lt;adj&gt;* &lt;n&gt;.

; lexicon

&lt;adj&gt; = old:"adjective" .
&lt;det&gt; = the:"determiner" .
&lt;n&gt;   = dog:"noun" .
</PRE> <p>

Now we use fsgtest with the -a option:

<pre>
<strong>
fsgtest -a np2.fsg
the dog</strong>
  the:"determiner" dog:"noun"
<strong>the old</strong>
  the:"determiner" old:"adjective"
<strong>the old dog</strong>
  the:"determiner" old:"adjective" dog:"noun"
<strong>[ctrl-c]</strong>
The external process was cancelled by a Ctrl+Break or another process.

 </pre>

<h2>FSGPRINT.EXE</h2>
This tool displays the fsg file as a graph. For each state in the
graph it displays the transitions from that state. For each transition
it displays both the terminal word associated with the transition and
the local probability of that transition. For example, using the np.fsg
listed above:

<pre>
<strong>fsgtest np.fsg</strong>

 --- fsg np.fsg ---

state 0
         the  -> state 1    p=1.00
state 1
         dog  -> state *    p=0.50
         old  -> state 1    p=0.50
state *


</pre>

This shows that the grammar has three states (state 0, state 1, and state *).
There is only one transition from state 0. It accepts the word "the" and
goes to state 1. If you are in state 0 the probability of taking this transition
is 1.00 since it is the only transition. State 1 has two transitions. The first
transition accepts the word "dog" and goes to the final state, state *.
The second transition accepts the word "old" and loops back to state 1. Since there
are two transition out of state 1, the local probability of both of these
transitions is 0.50.

<h3> Syntax of fsgprint.exe</h3>
The syntax of this tool is:<p>
<pre>
fsgprint [options] fsg-filename
</pre>

The available options are:
<p><DL>
<DT><strong>-v</strong>
<DD>This option displays more detailed information about the fsg file such as
the values of certain engine parameters and a more explicit description of the
graph .
</DL>
