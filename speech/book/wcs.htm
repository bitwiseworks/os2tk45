<H1>A guide to writing What Can I Say description files</H1>
<p>
The What Can I Say window dynamically displays phrases that
Voice Manager will recognize.  These phrases are not automatically
generated from a grammar file but must be written by hand in a
What Can I Say description file.  This allows for more control
over how a grammar is represented in the What Can I Say window.
For example, the grammar writer may want to organize the What
Can I Say information in a certain way, or may wish to elide
specific phrases.

<H2>Syntax of the description file</H2>
Each line of the description file contains an 8 character prefix.
Many of the character positions of this prefix are not used
by Voice Manager (they are used by other applications).
As a result, many of these
positions contain a period (".") as a placeholder. The
positions (from left to right) denote the following:
<DL>
<DT>column 1
<DD>The possible values for this column are:
<MENU>
<LI><strong><TT>T</TT></strong> denotes the title line. Each What Can I Say file
must start with a title line and there can only be one title line
per file.
<LI><strong><TT>H</TT></strong> denotes a heading. Typically, headers are names
of  general categories of phrases that a user might say. For example, a header might be "move commands". A What Can I
Say description file can be thought of as a simple outline. The headers
are general topics with phrases listed as entries underneath them.
<LI><strong><TT>X</TT></strong> denotes a phrase that can be said by a user.
<LI><strong><TT>D</TT></strong> denotes the start of a definition sequence.
This will be further explained in
<A HREF="wcs.htm#and-annotation">the section on the <TT>&&_</TT> annotation</A>.
</MENU>
<DT>column 2
<DD>The value of this column is always <strong><TT>E</TT></strong>
<DT>column 3
<DD>The possible values for this column are:
<MENU>
<LI><strong><TT>S</TT></strong> if the line is to be shown in the
What Can I Say Window.
<LI><strong><TT>H</TT></strong> if the line is to be hidden in the
What Can I Say Window. For example, the line may be intended as a
comment when viewing the description file.
</MENU>
<DT>column 4
<DD>The value of this column is always a period (".").
<DT>column 5
<DD>The value of this column can be:
<MENU>
<LI><strong><TT>.</TT></strong> (period), which is mandatory if the value of
the first column is D. It is also mandatory if the first column
is X and the line contains no <TT>&&_</TT> sequences.
<LI><strong><TT>+</TT></strong> which indicates that the subentries of this
line are collapsed.
<LI><strong><TT>-</TT></strong> which indicates that subentries of this
line are expanded. Either a <TT>+</TT> or <TT>-</TT> are required if
the first column is a <TT>T</TT> or an <TT>H</TT>. One of them is
also required if the first column is an <TT>X</TT> and the line
contains an <TT>&&_</TT> sequence.
</MENU>
<DT>column 6
<DD>The value of this column is always a period.
<DT>column 7
<DD>The value of this column is:
<MENU>
<LI><strong><TT>.</TT></strong> if the line is to be displayed in the
default font color (typically, black).
<LI><strong><TT>X</TT></strong> if the line is to be displayed in blue.
</MENU>
<DT>column 8
<DD>The value of this column is always a period.

<H2>An Example</H2>

<PRE>

TES.+...Simple Example
HES.+...Alignment Commands
XES.....align left
XES.....align right
XES.....center
XES.....justify
HES.+...Insertion Commands
XES.....insert bullet
XES.....insert note
XES.....insert today's date
XES.....insert time
XES.....insert page break

</PRE>

Recall that the <TT>+</TT> in column five indicates that the
line should be viewed with the subentries collapsed.
Thus, this grammar will add the following line to the What Can I Say
window:

<PRE>

+  Simple Example

</PRE>

If a user clicks on that line it will be expanded to

<PRE>

-  Simple Example
   + Alignment Commands
   + Insertion Commands

</PRE>

If a user clicks on the <TT>+ Alignment Commands</TT> line the
result will be:


<PRE>

-  Simple Example
   - Alignment Commands
       align left
       align right
       center
       justify
   + Insertion Commands

</PRE>

Suppose we change the first line of the description file from
<PRE>
TES.+...Simple Example
</PRE><p>
to
<PRE>
TES.-...Simple Example
</PRE>
<p>
replacing the <TT>+</TT> in column 5 with a <TT>-</TT>.
Now, instead of initially displaying the single line

<PRE>

+  Simple Example

</PRE>

the following will be displayed:

<PRE>

-  Simple Example
   + Alignment Commands
   + Insertion Commands

</PRE>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="and-annotation">The <TT>&&_</TT> annotation</A></H2>
Suppose you have the following two rules in your grammar file:

<PRE>

&lt;color-command&gt; = set the color to &lt;colors&gt; .
&lt;colors&gt; = red | orange | yellow | green | blue |
           indigo  | violet .

</PRE>

You may want the What Can I Say window to display the phrases
allowed by these rules as follows:

<PRE>

- Example

   set the color to red
   set the color to orange
   set the color to yellow
   set the color to green
   set the color to blue
   set the color to indigo
   set the color to violet

</PRE>

However, there is another way of presenting this information, which
may be more helpful to the users of your grammar.  A single line
might be displayed as in

<PRE>

- Example

  + set the color to <strong>colorname</strong>

</PRE>
A user can click on this line to expand it to:

<PRE>

  - set the color to <strong>colorname</strong>
    Possible values of colorname are
       red
       orange
       yellow
       green
       blue
       indigo
       violet

</PRE>

This format can easily be define in the What Can I say description
file by using the <TT>&&_</TT> annotation. The format of this annotation
is
<PRE>

   &&_<I>variable-name.annotation-name</I>_&&

</PRE>

where <I>annotation-name</I> is the string that will be displayed
to the user and <I>variable-name</I> is the name of a description
sequence that occurs at the end of the What Can I Say description
file.
For example, the following description file generates the above example:

 <PRE>

TES.-...Example
XES.+...set the color to &&_colorlist.colorname_&&
D.......colorlist
XES.....Possible values of colorname are
XES...C.   red
XES...C.   orange
XES...C.   yellow
XES...C.   blue
XES...C.   indigo
XES...C.   violet


</PRE>

<H3>The &&_Extern_counts.<count>_&& annotation</H3>
This annotation is a special case of the &&_ annotation mentioned
above. It is typically used to describe phrases generated by
a grammar that contains the line <TT>EXTERN &lt;Extern_counts&gt;</TT>.
This annotation does not require a description sequence and it is used as
follows.

<PRE>

TES.-...Example
XES.+...move up &&_Extern_counts.&lt;count&gt;_&& lines

</PRE>

The resulting What Can I Say display will be

<PRE>

- Example
  + move up &lt;count&gt; lines

</PRE>

When a user click on the  <TT>+ move up &lt;count&gt; lines</TT> line
the following display will result:



<PRE>

- Example
  - move up &lt;count&gt; lines
    Count values
      one
      two
      three
      four
      five
      six
      seven
      eight
      nine
      ten
      eleven
      twelve
      thirteen
      fourteen
      fifteen
      sixteen
      seventeen
      eighteen
      nineteen
      twenty
      thirty
      forty
      fifty
