<H1>Grammars</H1>
<p>Grammars are used in two contexts:
<UL>
<LI>They can be used by your speech-enabled application to specify
what phrases to accept (For example, to accept <I>move up three</I> and
not <I>move up tree</I>)
<LI>They can be used to enhance Voice Manager navigation of applications
that are not speech-enabled. In addition to describing what phrases to
accept, Voice Manager grammars also specify what action to take when a
given phrase is recognized (for example, to send the keystrokes
<TT>[up][up][up]</TT> when
<I>move up three</I> is recognized.)
