INTRODUCTION TO THE TOOLKIT

The IBM OS/2 Developer's Toolkit Version 4.5 provides development support
for new features in the "OS/2 Warp Server for e-business" operating system
and eComStation.

The Toolkit helps you develop applications for OS/2 by providing you with:

   - Header files
   - Library files
   - Online documents
   - Programming tools
   - Sample application programs


_______________________________________________________________________________
INSTALLING THE TOOLKIT

This section provides a step-by-step procedure for installing the Toolkit.

This Toolkit is a follow-on to previous releases and should not be considered
a replacement for any earlier release.  DO NOT install this toolkit "over"
any previous release.  For a first-time installation of this Toolkit, specify
an unused target location in the "Destination" field when prompted by the
Toolkit installation program.  For subsequent (additive) installations of this
release (for example, to install components that were not requested during the
original installation), the same destination directory may be respecified.

There may be Corrective Service Distributions (CSD's) available for this
release of the Toolkit.  Toolkit CSD's provide a mechanism for updating the
components of an existing Toolkit installation.  The CSD images are designed
to be installed "over" an existing Toolkit of the appropriate release.
CSD's for each release are numbered sequentially (from CSD1 to CSDn), and
the installation instructions for a particular "numbered" CSD can be found
in the "numbered" README file (eg. README.1) included with the CSD package.

_______________________________________________________________________________
System Requirements

The following is the prerequisite software required:

   o  One of the following versions of the OS/2 operating system:

      - eComStation 1.0/1.1/1.2.x
      - OS/2 Warp Server for e-business
      - OS/2 Warp Version 4
      - OS/2 Warp Version 3
      - OS/2 Warp with WIN-OS/2 Version 3
      - OS/2 Warp Connect
      - OS/2 Warp Connect with WIN-OS/2

   o  Various components have additional software requirements.  The
      Toolkit components that you choose to install will function only if
      the underlying operating system supports the component.  Some of the
      additional requirements include the following:

      - Open32 samples require the Open32 interfaces (previously known as
        the IBM Developer API Extensions for OS/2 or DAPIE)
      - OpenGL samples require OpenGL (also referred to as Enhanced 3D
        Graphics)
      - All REXX samples, with the exception of the REXX API samples,
        require Object REXX
 
        Note: The features listed above are available on OS/2 Warp Server for
              e-business and OS/2 Warp Version 4.  If you are using version 3
              of the OS/2 operating system, you will need to obtain support
              for these components either via FixPak 17 or later (for Open32
              support), or from the Developer Connection CD (for OpenGL and
              Object REXX support).

   o   To use the latest level of Universal Language Support, one of the
       following operating systems is required:

       - OS/2 Warp Server for e-business
       - OS/2 Warp Version 4
       - OS/2 Warp Version 3 with FixPak 32 or later 

       If you do not have Universal Language Support, you will receive errors 
       when using the NMAKE32, RC, and MKTMPF tools.  

   o   The new TCP/IP Toolkit Version 4.21 is also provided, which contains
       sample programs that take advantage of the new 32-bit TCP/IP interfaces
       in OS/2 Warp Server for e-business.  If you are using an older version
       of the operating system, these sample programs may fail with the error
       "SYS1804: The system cannot find the file TCPIP32" if the target machine
       is not configured with TCP/IP Version 4.1 or newer.

Before you install the Toolkit, make sure you have:

   -  A personal computer capable of running OS/2 Warp

   -  A CD-ROM drive

   -  A hard disk drive with at least 90 MB of free disk space (to
      install the entire Toolkit)

We recommend that you use a mouse when installing the Toolkit.

If you will be installing the IBM VisualAge C++ 3.0 compiler, please read the
following notes:

      Installing your compiler first and the OS/2 Warp Toolkit last
      prevents unexpected results due to environment variable changes
      (automatic updates to CONFIG.SYS).  To avoid a downlevel SOM Runtime
      installed by the VisualAge C++ 3.0 compiler, follow these steps for
      installation:

      1. Start the installation program for VisualAge C++ 3.0.

      2. Deselect the OS/2 Warp Toolkit entries in the installation screen
         and proceed with the installation.

      3. After completing the installation of VisualAge C++, but before
         restarting the system, edit CONFIG.SYS and modify the LIBPATH
         statement by moving x:\IBMCPP\DLL after y:\OS2\DLL, where x is
         the drive where the VisualAge C++ compiler is installed and y is
         the drive where the OS/2 Warp Version 4 operating system files
         are installed.  This prevents the SOM Runtime installed by
         VisualAge C++ from overriding the SOM Runtime shipped with OS/2
         Warp Version 4.

      4. Save the modified CONFIG.SYS and restart your system.

      5. Install the IBM OS/2 Developer's Toolkit Version 4.5 and restart
         your system.


_______________________________________________________________________________
Installation Program

Install all or part of the Toolkit using the Toolkit Installation program
(a Presentation Manager/2 (PM) application) on the CD-ROM.  Using the
Toolkit Installation program, you can install:

     - Header files
     - Library files
     - Online documents
     - Programming tools
     - Sample application programs

The Toolkit Installation will copy chosen files to your machine and update
CONFIG.SYS with respect to the locally installed files.


_______________________________________________________________________________
Installation Help

To get online help while using the Toolkit Installation program, do one of
the following:

   -  Press F1
   -  Select the Help push button
   -  Choose one of the help choices from the Help menu

_______________________________________________________________________________
Installing the Toolkit

To install the Toolkit, do the following:

   1. Start the Toolkit Installation Program:
    
      - If you are installing the Toolkit from the images provided on the OS/2
        Warp Server for e-business installation CD, execute the "tkinstal.exe"
        program located in the "toolkit" subdirectory.

      - If you are installing the Toolkit from an IBM Developer Toolbox
        (formerly known as the Developer Connection) CD-ROM and are using the
        interfaces provide by the Developer Toolbox, follow the instructions
        provided by that interface.

      - If you are working directly with the "installation image" of the
        Toolkit (for example, you have downloaded and unpacked on online
        version of the toolkit, or you are referencing the subdirectory
        tree of the installation image as it exists on the CD-ROM), then
        locate and execute the "tkinstal.exe" program.

   2.  The IBM OS/2 Developer's Toolkit Version 4.5 Installation window is
       displayed.  Select each component you want to install.  Depending on
       the components you select for installation, additional components might
       be automatically selected for installation.  A plus (+) sign in a box
       in front of a component indicates that the component has at least one
       level of subcomponents from which you can select.  Select the plus
       sign in front of the component to expand the list of components.

   3.  If desired, change the default destination for the selected
       components by editing the "Destination" field.  If the entire
       Toolkit is not required, components may still be deselected in the
       usual manner.  However, it is important that the paths are not
       changed from their defaults for all components other than the root,
       because the directory structure on the CD-ROM cannot be changed.

   4.  Select Options to specify what updates to your system are required.
       You can choose to:

          - Install the selected files.
          - Register Workplace Shell classes for the components that
            utilize them.
          - Create Workplace Shell objects.
          - Select the file where any CONFIG.SYS updates are to be made,
            or deselect the "Write CONFIG.SYS updates to:" check box to
            prevent the Toolkit Installation program from updating
            CONFIG.SYS.

   5.  To install all selected components of the Toolkit:

          a. Select Install.
          b. Follow the prompts in the message boxes to complete the
             installation.

   6.  A message box is displayed indicating successful completion of the
       installation.

   7.  To make the changes effective, remove any installation media from the
       bootable devices, shut down and restart your system.  After the Toolkit
       is installed, the Toolkit folder appears on the Desktop, represented by
       a toolbox icon.



_______________________________________________________________________________
UPDATES TO CONFIG.SYS

The Toolkit Installation program adds the paths of all needed environment
variables with the appropriate Toolkit path.  These variables include
BOOKSHELF, DPATH, HELP, and so on.  If you choose to make these updates
manually, do the following before installing the Toolkit:

   1. Select Options from the Toolkit Installation program.

   2. Change the file name in the "Write CONFIG.SYS updates to:" field to
      something other than CONFIG.SYS (for example, CONFIG.001).

   3. This file can be compared to your original CONFIG.SYS once the
      installation is complete.  You can then make the appropriate
      modifications to CONFIG.SYS as you choose.



_______________________________________________________________________________
PROGRAMMING CONSIDERATIONS

  o The OS/2 C libraries provide all of the functions necessary for C
    development; however, they do not support C++ development.  Currently,
    this support must be provided by a compiler vendor.

  o If you are using the C Runtime Headers provided with the Toolkit, be
    sure to link with the C Runtime libraries provided in the LIB
    directory to prevent link errors.  If you are not using the C Runtime
    libraries, you should not use the C Runtime Headers provided in the 
    Toolkit.

  o MPTS programming information is included in the TCP/IP Programming
    Reference.


_______________________________________________________________________________
Tools

  o  There are two versions of the Program Maintenance Utility (NMAKE) and
     of the Resource Compiler (RC).  The default versions of these tools are
     referenced by the names "NMAKE" and "RC" and the "alternate" versions
     of these tools are referenced by the names "NMAKE32" and "RC16".  The
     differences between these tools are as follows:

     NMAKE   - This is the "old" Program Maintenance Utility.  Because of the
               semantic and syntactic differences between this utility and
               the "new" version of NMAKE (NMAKE32), the old version has been
               restored as the default program maintenance utility.  This
               version of NMAKE is documented in the Tools Reference book.

     NMAKE32 - This is the "Enhanced Program Maintenance Utility".  In the
               previous release of the Toolkit (IBM Developer's Toolkit for
               OS/2 Warp Version 4) this was the default NMAKE utility, but
               it has been renamed to NMAKE32 for this release.  This version
               of NMAKE is documented in the file "book\nmake32.inf".

     RC16    - This is the old "Legacy Resource Compiler".  It is included for
               customers who cannot update their resource scripts to compile
               with the newer version of RC.  This version of RC is documented
               in the file "book\rc16.inf".

     RC      - This is the "new" Resource Compiler.  Where possible, backward
               compatibility with RC16 is maintained, but the new RC has
               stricter syntax checking and may issue errors against some
               resource scripts.  This version of RC also contains additional
               features such as true national language support and a full-
               featured C-language preprocessor.  This version of RC is
               documented in the Tools Reference book.


  o  If you encounter a trap in LIBUNI.DLL when using Make Template File
     (MKTMPF) or the Resource Compiler (RC) on an OS/2 Warp Version 3
     system, change the SET LANG=ENUS437 statement in CONFIG.SYS to SET
     LANG=EN_US.


_______________________________________________________________________________
VoiceType Developer's Toolkit

  o  The VoiceType Developer's Toolkit online documentation is in HTML
     format.  You need an HTML browser, such as IBM WebExplorer or
     Netscape Navigator for OS/2 Warp, to view it.
_______________________________________________________________________________


_______________________________________________________________________________
TCP/IP

  o  Compiling an application with the BSD 4.3 header files:

     The 4.3 BSD header files (for TCP/IP versions prior to 4.1) are also 
     included with this Toolkit.  To access the header files, define 
     TCPV40HDRS before including (#include) any of the TCP/IP header
     files.  Do this on the command line with the /D switch:

         icc /DTCPV40HDRS /c myprog.c

     or in your .c file:

     #define TCPV40HDRS
     #include <sys\socket.h>
      ...

     To link an application that was compiled with these header files, 
     you must specify so32dll.lib and tcp32dll.lib on the link line:

      ilink /NOFREEFORMAT myprog,myprog.exe,NULL, so32dll.lib tcp32dll.lib

  o  Update to "Compiling an RPC API Application"

     Use these steps to compile and link an RPC API application using IBM 
     VisualAge C++ for OS/2: 

     1. To compile your program, enter: 

      icc /DTCPV40HDRS /C myprog.c

     2. To create an executable program, you can enter (on one line): 

      ilink /NOFREEFORMAT myprog,myprog.exe,NULL, rpc32dll.lib 
            so32dll.lib tcp32dll.lib


     Notes:
     -  The RPC API is not re-entrant.  If you are creating a multithreaded 
        program, you must serialize the access to the APIs. 

     -  For more information about the compile and link options, and 
        dynamic link libraries, see the user's guide provided with your 
        compiler. 

     -  RPC applications must be compiled using the 4.3 BSD API (pre-TCP/IP 
        4.1 header files).  Using the 4.4 header files with an RPC application 
        is not supported.
_______________________________________________________________________________


_______________________________________________________________________________
SOM

  o  As of 6/97, IBM no longer supports SOM.
