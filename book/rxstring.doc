              RXSTRING Library of Functions (RXSTRING.LIB)



The RXSTRING.LIB library provides analogues of many of the standard C library
functions for the RXSTRING structure (which is used in conjunction with the
REXX interpreter), as well as a sampling of functions which convert standard
C strings into RXSTRING's.

The functions provided for OS/2 2.0 are 32-bit only.  They must be called
from 32-bit code.  For 16-bit RXSTRING functions, use the 1.2 or 1.3 OS/2 Toolkit
version of RXSTRING.LIB

The following functions are available:

   Group 1: Numeric conversion functions

      INT   rxtoi(RXSTRING);
      LONG  rxtol(RXSTRING);
      ULONG rxtoul(RXSTRING);

      - these functions convert RXSTRING's into integer values, similar to the
        atoi(), atol(), and atoul() functions

   Group 2: File I/O functions

      LONG rxwrite(HFILE, RXSTRING);
      LONG rxread(HFILE, PRXSTRING);
      VOID rxprint(RXSTRING)

      - these functions will read and write RXSTRING's, including structure
        information, to and from a file, as well as writing the data contained
        in an RXSTRING to stdout

   Group 3: Copy / Conversion functions

      RXSTRING rxstrdup(RXSTRING);
      RXSTRING rxmemcpy(PRXSTRING, PRXSTRING, ULONG);
      RXSTRING rxstrcpy(PRXSTRING, PRXSTRING);
      RXSTRING rxstrncpy(PRXSTRING, PRXSTRING, ULONG);
      RXSTRING rxstrcat(PRXSTRING, PRXSTRING);
      RXSTRING rxstrncat(PRXSTRING, PRXSTRING, ULONG);
      RXSTRING strdup2rx(PUCHAR, ULONG);
      RXSTRING memcpy2rx(PRXSTRING, PUCHAR, ULONG);
      RXSTRING strcpy2rx(PRXSTRING, PSZ);
      RXSTRING strcat2rx(PRXSTRING, PSZ);
      RXSTRING strncat2rx(PRXSTRING, PSZ, ULONG);

      - these functions will duplicate, copy and/or concatenate RXSTRING's with
        RXSTRING's and RXSTRING's with standard strings/buffers

        NOTE: Except for the "dup" functions, all of the functions require that
              the destination string contain sufficient storage for completion
              of the requested operation.  The concatenation functions begin
              appending at the current length of the RXSTRING.  Therefore,
              enough storage should be available for the original length plus
              the length of the data to be added to the string.

   Group 4: Comparison / Character functions

      LONG  rxstrcmp(PRXSTRING, PRXSTRING);
      LONG  rxstricmp(PRXSTRING, PRXSTRING);
      LONG  rxmemcmp(PRXSTRING, PRXSTRING, ULONG);
      LONG  rxmemicmp(PRXSTRING, PRXSTRING, ULONG);
      PUCHAR rxstrchr(PRXSTRING, UCHAR);
      PUCHAR rxstrrchr(PRXSTRING, UCHAR);

      - these functions are analogues of the standard C library comparison
        functions (strcmp, stricmp, memcmp, and memicmp) and character
        search functions (strchr and strrchr), and return values similar to
        those functions

   Group 5: Miscellaneous functions

      RXSTRING rxalloc(ULONG);
      VOID rxfree(RXSTRING);
      VOID rxstrnset(RXSTRING, UCHAR, ULONG);
      ULONG rxstrlen(RXSTRING);
      RXSTRING rxset_length(PRXSTRING, ULONG);
      RXSTRING rxset_null(PRXSTRING);
      RXSTRING rxset_zerolen(PRXSTRING);
      RXSTRING rxreturn_value(PRXSTRING, PUCHAR, ULONG);
      PUCHAR _make_hptr(RXSTRING);

      - the first three functions handle allocating, freeing, and overwriting
        RXSTRING structures.  The rxstrlen and rxset_length functions retrieve
        and set the length information contained in RXSTRING's without
        affecting the associated memory for the string. The rxset_null function
        sets the rxstring to null, similarly rxset_zerolen function sets the
        rxstring to a zero length rxstring. The _make_hptr function returns a
        pointer to the data buffer associated with an RXSTRING, if any
        exists. The rxreturn_value function may be used to replace the logic
        for figuring out if you should use the preallocated buffer for
        return values or create your own buffer. The preallocated rxstring
        return value is used with subcommands, external functions, and
        variable pool.
