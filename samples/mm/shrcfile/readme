 Resource file Sample
 --------------------

 The following files are used to build the sample stream handler resource
 file.	The example contains the System Resource file for MMPM/2 stream
 handlers, and shows the stream protocol control block (SPCB) information
 that has been tuned to be the most efficient with several types of data.



 RCSTUB.C     - Stub 'C' source file used to create AUDIORES.DLL.

 SSMRES.RC    - This file contains all SPCB's used by MMPM/2 stream handlers.

 MAKEFILE     - Makefile to build SSMRES.DLL

 SHRCINI.SCR  - Install file used to invoke SpiInstall, which updates the
		SPI.INI file with the SPCB's contained in the SHRC.DLL

 SHRCLST.SCR  - Install file containing a list of files needed to update
		SPI.INI.

 CONTROL.SCR  - Install control file containing information about the update
		of SPI.INI.

 SHRC.DLL     - Resource DLL, built from RCSTUB.C and SSMRES.RC files.


 To build the resource DLL, run the makefile. This will build an SHRC.DLL
 and add the resource file to it.

 Once the resource DLL is built, MINSTALL is used to update SPI.INI profile
 as follows:

   1. Copy the files CONTROL.SCR, SHRCINI.SCR, SHRCLST.SCR and SHRC.DLL
      to a diskette and insert in drive 'A'.

   2. Type MINSTALL to update the SPI.INI profile.
