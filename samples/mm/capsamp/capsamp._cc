00000000 Welcome to MMPM/2's sample captioning system.
00005712 We call it our sample captioning system because
00015618 we've provided it, source code and all, as an
00024303 example of one way to implement captioning with
00030855 MMPM/2.  The sample can be used as it's provided,
00045714 or it can be modified to suit your specific needs.
00053331 This sample captioning system is made up of three
00062856 parts.  The first part of the system is the Caption
00071238 Creation Utility.  This allows you to synchronize
00077940 an audio file with a text file.  The second part
00089979 of the system is the Caption DLL.  This DLL provides
00098133 three api's that allow an application to display,
00109104 manage, and hide a caption window.  The third part
00119238 of the system is the Caption Sample Application that
00129369 shows programmers how to use the three api's provided
00137142 by the DLL in order to display a caption
00146055 window in their application.
