C)   RPC consists of three C programs: RAWX.C, GENESEND.C, and 
     GENESERV.C (located in \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\TCPIPTK\RPC).

     RAWX.C provides an example of the RAW Client/Server usage.  
       Portmapper must be running.  
     GENESERV.C is a generic server.  It receives an integer or float and 
       returns them respectively.  Portmapper must be running.  
     GENESEND.C  sends an integer to the remote host (GENESEND) and
       receives the integer back at the local host.  Portmapper and Remote 
       server (GENESEND) must be running.  

     Following are details on building and executing the RPC Samples:

     (1) To Compile and Link the sample program, type:

           nmake  -f rpcsamp.mak

     (2) To start Portmapper, type:

           start portmap

     (3) To start the geneserv.exe server, type:

           start geneserv

     (4) To run genesend.exe, type:
           
           genesend hostname integer

         For example,

           genesend charm 1000

     (5) To run rawex.exe, type:
           
           rawex integer

         For example,

           rawex 1000
