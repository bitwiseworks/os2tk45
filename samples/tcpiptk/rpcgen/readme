     RPCGEN consists of three user written files, RG.X, RGUS.C
     and RGUC.C (located in \TOOLKIT\SAMPLES\TCPIPTK\RPCGEN).

     RG.X defines the remote procedure characteristics.
     RGUS.C demonstrates an RPC Server program.
     RGUC.C demonstrates an RPC Client program.

     Following are details on building and executing the
     RPCGEN Samples:

     1)  Perform the following:

           rpcgen rg.x

         This generates rg.h, rg.i, rgs.c, rgc.c, and rgx.c.

     2)  From rgx.c, add the include headers to rgus.c, and rguc.c
         (if they don't already exists).

     3)  Run rpcgsamp.cmd to compile rgus.c, rguc.c, rgs.c, and rgc.c.
         Link rgs.obj, and rgus.obj to generate rgs.exe.
         Link rgc.obj, and rguc.obj to generate rgc.exe.

     4)  Start portmap.exe, and rgs.exe on the same machine:

           start portmap
           start rgs

     5)  Start rgc.exe by typing:

           rgc hostname "user_input string"
