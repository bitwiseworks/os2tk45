RCOPY makes use of the FTP API (FTPAPI.DLL) to transfer a directory and
all of its subdirectories between a client and FTP server.  RCOPY does
not read userid or password from the NETRC file so they must be specified
when required.

     put  transfers from local host to remote host (default)
     get  transfers from remote host to local host.
     binary  Binary transfer mode (default).
     ascii   ASCII transfer mode.

Following are the details on building and executing the RCOPY Sample:

     1.  To compile and link the sample, type:

           nmake -f vacpp.mak         (to build using the VisualAge C/C++ compiler)

     2.  Executing rcopy.exe

         a)  Command Syntax

               RCOPY put|get ascii|binary [-l<local path>] -h<host>

                       oleg     is a remote host (ftp server)
