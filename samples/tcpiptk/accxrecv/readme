ACCEPT_AND_RECV
---------------
The accept_and_recv() API function accepts a connection on a socket, receives
the first message from the connected client, and returns the local and peer
addresses.
It accepts a new connection, receives the first block of data from the client
and returns the local and remote addresses to the application.  The thread
sleeping on accept_and_recv() wakes-up only after it gets the first data block
from the client.

SAMPLES FOR ACCEPT_AND_RECV
---------------------------

There are two exes named

a) accept.exe   - TCP server application
b) recv.exe     - TCP client application

for explaining the accept_and_recv. The server opens a socket to which
it binds and then does a listen on that socket.  It starts the number of
specified threads and does accept_and_recv on each of them.
The client opens a socket, connects to the server and sends the data.
As the timeout option is set(by using setsockopt), whenever the client
connects but doesn't send any data, the server times out.

The server can be started  as follows -

accept [server port] [number of acceptex threads]
where:
a) [server port] - stands for the port number to which  the server is to be bound.
b) [number of acceptex threads] - stands for the number of simultaneous threads
   on which accept_and_recv is to be done.

The client can be started as follows -

recv [server port]
where;
a) [server port] - is the port on which the server is bound.

COMPILATION
------------

The source code for the server and the client are in the files
by name -

1) accept.c
2) recv.c

These can be compiled by using the makefile given and running
the following command

nmake /a
