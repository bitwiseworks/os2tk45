  This README document contains information that describes how the
  .IDL files for the WorkPlace Shell Car C++ Sample are to be used.

  These files are provided on an as-is basis for evaluation and
  demonstration.  They are not intended for use with production code.

  The files included in this release have been provided for evaluation
  by developers who have the SOMobjects Toolkit* and want to write their
  WorkPlace Shell subclasses using the Interface Definition Language
  (IDL) described in the SOMobjects Toolkit.

  CAR - WORKPLACE OBJECT SAMPLE
  _____________________________

  CAR demonstrates how to create a workplace object using basic object oriented
  programming techniques and the IBM System Object Model (SOM), including:

  o   Initializing an object
  o   Adding settings pages to an object
  o   Saving and restoring the state of an object
  o   Modifying object context menus (adding and deleting menu items)
  o   Querying of object class data
  o   Processing context menu items
  o   Implementing settings page dialog processing.

  The CAR sample is available as a C and C++ sample in the Toolkit.

To build and install the Car C++ Sample in this directory:

1) edit the makefile CARPP.MAK so that it pertains to your environment

   þ  Set the TOOLKIT macro to the drive and path on which you installed
      the Toolkit.
   þ  Set the IBMCPP macro to point to the installed C Set++ compiler.
   þ  Make sure that the WorkPlace Shell idls and headers are in your INCLUDE
      and SMINCLUDE paths as necessary.

2) nmake -f carpp.mak

3) register the Carpp class and create an instance of Carpp
   using a REXX script like INSTALL.CMD, or by using Object Utility/2.
