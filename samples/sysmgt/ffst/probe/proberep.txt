*Detail data allows you to format the FFSTProbes log_user_data (if used). You can use as
*many Detail data phrases as needed and they can overlap the same data. The format is
*Detail_data = L,O,H,T where L is Length of data, O is the Offset it starts at, T is the Type
*of data as it was sent and how you want it formated (e.g. binary show as hex) and H is *The Heading message number you want to display with it.
