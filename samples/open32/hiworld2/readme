This version of HIWORLD will run without changes on an OS/2 system with
the DAPIE extensions installed.  For your reference, an executable is included.

It is built from the Win32 version following these steps:

        1) Convert Win32 resource file (HIWORLD.RC) to OS/2 resource file
           using the SMART tool (Version 2.1B).  Note that SMART will rename
           your Win32 resource file (.rc) to .rcx and will create an OS/2
           resource file with the .rc extension.
        2) Convert cursor file (CURSOR1.CUR) and icon file (ICON2.ICO) to
           OS/2 format using the SMART tool (Version 2.1B).
        3) Change includes of <windows.h> to includes of <os2win.h>. This
           is done in hiworld.c via an #ifdef.
        4) Create a .DEF file and specify a stack size of at least 64K.  There
           is a sample .DEF file in this directory.
        5) Compile and link MAIN.C (found in the toolkit\c directory under your
           DAPIE directory) with HIWORLD.C to form HIWORLD.EXE.  This is done
           in the makefile provided with this sample.
        6) Run HIWORLD.EXE as you would any other OS/2 executable.

This sample was built with IBM C/Set++ Version 2.01 and the OS/2 Developer's
Toolkit for OS/2 Warp Version 3.
