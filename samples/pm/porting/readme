IMAGE PORTING APPLICATION
=========================

The purpose of the IMAGE sample is twofold :-

  i) to demonstrate how to port an existing 16-bit application, which
     can be run on the toolkit supplied with OS/2 1.3, to 32-bit.

  ii) to demonstrate the Image functionality of the GPI, and the standard
      File Open dialog.

Looking at each of the above statements in more detail...

GPI Image Functions/File Open Dialog
------------------------------------
  This program displays an image using the GpiImage() call. The image
data comes from a file which the user must select using the standard
File Open dialog which is invoked by selecting 'Open...' on the
File submenu.
  If the selected image is larger than the maximum picture area, any
part of the image lying off the screen can be scrolled by using the
horizontal and vertical scroll bars.  Alternatively, the entire
image can be displayed by stretching or compressing it to fit the
target rectangle. This is the way the image is displayed initially.

  An image-data file comprises a file header (which contains the
image width and height in pels) and the pel data itself (which
describes the on and off settings of the pels in the image).

  An image-data file has the following format:

                    IMAGE WIDTH (in BYTES)
 BYTE    0          1          2          3         4
   -------------------------------------------------------
   | <space>   |  <space> | <space>  | <space>  | Comma  |
   | or ASCII  | or ASCII | or ASCII | or ASCII |   ,    |
   |  digit    |  digit   |  digit   |  digit   |        |
   |(Thousands)|(Hundreds)| (Tens)   |  (Ones)  |        |
   -------------------------------------------------------


           IMAGE HEIGHT (in PELS)
 BYTE    5          6          7          8
   ----------------------------------------------
   | <space>   | <space>  | <space>  | <space>  |
   | or ASCII  | or ASCII | or ASCII | or ASCII |
   |  digit    |  digit   |  digit   |  digit   |
   |(Thousands)|(Hundreds)|  (Tens)  |  (Ones)  |
   ----------------------------------------------


                      IMAGE DATA
 BYTE    10         11                      End of File
    --------------------------------------------------
    |          |          |                          |
    |  Binary  |  Binary  |       . . . . . .        |
    |  data    |  data    |                          |
    |          |          |                          |
    --------------------------------------------------


Porting to 32-Bit
-----------------
  It details the intermediate stages to achieve the port.  As a result there
are more than one .MAK/.DEF file in order to illustrate building different
versions of the IMAGE application.
You will find these groups of .MAK/.DEF files:

  a) IMAGE16.MAK/.DEF - pure 16-bit application that can be compiled using
                        the OS/2 1.3 tools/headers/libraries.

  b) IMAGES1.MAK/.DEF - Port to 32-bit : Stage 1 - This involves recompiling
                        the original source using the OS/2 2.0 headers and
                        the 32-bit tools/libraries for 32-bit source
                        files, and 16-bit tools/libraries for the 16-bit
                        source file.  Note: the 16-bit utility routines are
                        primarily for demonstration purposes only, and should
                        not be considered for real applications in their
                        current form.

  c) IMAGE32.MAK/.DEF - pure 32-bit application that can be compiled using
                        the OS/2 2.0 tools/headers/libraries.

The IMAGE32.MAK/.DEF files will produce a 32-bit executable file of the same
name, IMAGE32.EXE.  The IMAGE16.MAK/IMAGES1.MAK and .DEF files are provided
for comparison purposes.  Together with the source files, they are not
sufficient to build a 16-bit executable.  They have a dependency on an OS/2 1.3
toolkit being available locally, since they need 16-bit compilers/linkers.  The
sample source files contain conditional compilation statements for PORT_16,
which show some of the changes needed in making the port.

                 to be used with the Dialog Editor.

                 and Exit List processing routines
