Print Sample Application
------------------------

This is a sample application which shows how to print text and graphics under
OS/2. It also shows how to handle printer queues, job properties, and fonts.
The time-consuming parts are handled by separate threads.

Detailed information about this application and the how to print from
applications can be found in "OS/2 Programming Guide".


Things you can do to improve this application
---------------------------------------------

1. Wrap text when it is outside the user define margins. This is required for
a word-processor. The text is left clipped to show how a clip path can be used
to enforce the user-defined margins.
2. Allow the user to page backward through a multi-page document. This requires
more extensive formatting on a separate thread but has the advantage that the
user can tell exactly how large the document is and what is the current page.
3. Allow the user to do title-bar drag/drop onto a printer.
4. Allow the user to drag/drop a file associated with this application onto
a printer. PRTSAMP is then called with the DM_PRINTOBJECT message.
5. Allow for BMP files that contain an array of bitmaps.
6. Support ICO and PTR files.
7. Support device fonts and character positioning of a screen font according
to the device font characteristics.
